# Di-Kreyol

**Di-Kreyol** is a web-based application built to serve as a comprehensive dictionary for Haitian Creole. The core idea behind this project stemmed from the lack of accessible and reliable resources that offer definitions in Haitian Creole for native speakers. While translation tools exist, they often fall short when it comes to providing complete word meanings, proper usage, and synonyms in the context of Haitian Creole.

The mission of Di-Kreyol is to bridge this gap by creating a digital platform that not only defines words but also strengthens the cultural and linguistic identity of Haitian users. This application allows anyone—especially native Haitian Creole speakers—to search for a word and receive a well-structured explanation, along with synonyms, in their native language.

## 🎯 Project Motivation

As a native Haitian, I found it frustrating to search for a definition in my own language and only find translation tools that convert words to English or French. These tools rarely capture the essence, depth, or contextual meaning of a word in Haitian Creole. I realized that there was a need for a proper dictionary—one that is made for Creole speakers by someone who understands the language and culture.

That realization led to the creation of Di-Kreyol. This platform is designed to help students, teachers, writers, and anyone curious about Haitian Creole deepen their understanding of the language. Whether for academic use or personal curiosity, Di-Kreyol brings native definitions to the forefront, encouraging literacy and appreciation for the language.
